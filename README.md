Controllers play a critical role in the AngularJS framework. In this module you'll learn the role that controllers play, how they can be created, and how scope fits into the picture for binding data to views using a data-oriented approach. You'll also learn how to create an AngularJS module and how to add controllers into it.

    + properties go on the scope
    + methods include click or mouse enter/leave
  + Handles showing/hiding controls and data views
    + factories and services
  + Handles events triggered by a view
  + Knows how to retrieve data
  + Interacts with the view using the $scope object
+ The role of the $scope
  + $scope is "injected" into a controller
  + Provides the data specific to what the view is going to render
  + View binds to the scope properties and functions
