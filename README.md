In this module you'll learn the difference between control-oriented and data-oriented programming and see how AngularJS data-binding functionality will save you time and allow you to focus on your application's data. You'll also learn about the role of views and directives and see several directives in action. Finally, you'll learn about filters and how they can be used to filter, format, and sort data in AngularJS SPA applications.

+ Additional Directives:
  + 1. <a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngCloak">ng-cloak</a>
    + When loading the page, sometimes the data binding will be visible; this will look unprofessional
    + Add this in at the smallest level possible such that the display will be set to none on initial load
    + add ng-cloak to your own css so that when the page loads, there will be no flicker
  + 2. <a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngSwitch">ng-switch</a>
  + 3.  <a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngClass">ng-class</a>
