In this module you'll learn the difference between control-oriented and data-oriented programming and see how AngularJS data-binding functionality will save you time and allow you to focus on your application's data. You'll also learn about the role of views and directives and see several directives in action. Finally, you'll learn about filters and how they can be used to filter, format, and sort data in AngularJS SPA applications.

    + Directives teach HTML new tricks
  + What can Directives do?
    + DOM Manipulation -> Data Binding -> Controllers/ Modules -> View Loading -> CSS -> Events
